```lrc
[00:00.25] I saw the look in her eyes
[00:03.39] On the train as we're passing
[00:05.57] I pictured us dancing
[00:07.27] This feeling caught me by surprise
[00:10.58] In this small little moment
[00:13.16] You gone without notice
[00:24.66] 
[00:14.92] And I wish i could tell you
[00:22.71] What i'm thinking still
[00:34.21] 
[00:30.05] I was lost in the motion
[00:32.34] And struck by the image of you
[00:37.68] In the midst of my transit
[00:39.75] I felt deep in love with the view
[00:56.25] 
[00:45.39] To the girl at the station
[00:47.12] I'm patiently waiting for us
[00:50.48] To pass again
[00:56.98] 
[01:00.84] And to think i've done this before
[01:04.48] It'll drive me insane till I see you again
[01:08.26] Am I foolish to say there'll be more
[01:12.14] Interactions between us
[01:14.48] It's you that I dream of
[01:26.48] 
[01:16.58] And I wish I could tell ya
[01:23.86] What I'm thinking still
[01:35.36] 
[01:31.67] I was lost in the motion
[01:33.66] And struck by the image of you
[01:38.95] In the midst of my transit
[01:41.06] I felt deep in love with the view
[01:57.56] 
[01:46.63] To the girl at the station
[01:48.70] I'm patiently waiting for us
[01:51.93] To pass again
[01:58.43] 
[01:57.35] Oh
